# Employee Management System

## The Task

To create a command line program that allows you to manage an SQL database of employees, departments and roles.

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a program that adhere's to the criteria
- A deeper understanding of modules and how they interact with each other.
- A deeper understanding of SQL and it interactions
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it
